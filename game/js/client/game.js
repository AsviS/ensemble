* Each state object will be populated by Phaser-specific properties, but can contain custom ones as well, as exemplified below.
* For the moment, Ensemble only needs one main game state. The states are declared in game/js/client/main.js.

/**
 * Several methods are automatically called by Phaser in the course of the game. Phaser will look for them in the state
 * object of the current state, therefore they are added to our Game object. These methods are:
 * Game.init(): called at the very beginning of the game, to initialize a few parameters.
 * Game.preload(): automatically called after init(), used to load the assets of the game.
 * Game.create(): called once preload() is done. Use to set up the game and possibly already display things, like the map (if any).
 * Game.update(): the main update loop of the game, called once per frame. Can be used to update the state of the players,
 * check for collisions, etc. In the case of Ensemble, the movements are taken care of by a tween, so Phaser takes care of the
 * updates and the rendering under the hood. Therefore, there is not much to see in update() yet, apart from listening to
 * mouse clicks or taps.
